vagrant-fedora
==============

This is a simple virtual machine to be used as a development environment for myself. It's still in its early stages and only supports a command line vim as the main IDE.

Installation instructions
==============

 1. Download and install Vagrant: https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html
 2. ```git clone https://github.com/vesanieminen/vagrant-fedora```
 3. ```cd vagrant-fedora```

 5. Grab a cup of coffee and watch the installation go by in about five minutes :)
